# fur

<br>

`fur` is a utility to easily perform actions related to Git repos hosted online, such as (and not limited to) opening
your repo in a browser or jump directly to the PR creating page.

Why the name `fur`? Because that's what you get after moving the keys of `git` one step to the left on a QWERTY
keyboard. It's pretty memorable, too.
