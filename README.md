# fur

<sub>"Git macro-ish thingy."</sub>

<br>

`fur` is a utility to easily execute certain frequently-used commands or actions related to Git repositories. Including things that `git` should not be doing, like opening your repo in a browser or jump directly to the PR creating page. That is what `fur` aims to do, making life dealing with Git repositories a little bit lazier. 

Why the name `fur`? Because that's what you get after moving the keys of `git` one step to the left on a QWERTY keyboard. It's pretty memorable, too.
